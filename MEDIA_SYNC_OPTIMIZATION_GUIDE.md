- Parallel processing effectiveness

## Performance Impact Estimates

| Optimization | Previous Performance | Improved Performance | Implementation Effort |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Streaming Property Validation | O(n) memory | 60-80% memory reduction | Medium |
| Optimized Batch Sizing | 70% API efficiency | 85-90% API efficiency | Low |
| Parallel Processing | Sequential | 200-300% speed increase | Medium |
| Database Indexing | Slow queries | 50-70% query speedup | Low |
| Memory Streaming | High memory usage | 70-90% memory reduction | Medium |
| Performance Monitoring | No visibility | Full observability | Medium |

## How to Apply the Optimizations

### Step 1: Run Database Optimization

```bash
# Run the database optimization script
node scripts/optimize-database.js
```

This will create all necessary indexes for improved performance.

### Step 2: Test Performance

```bash
# Run the performance test script
node scripts/test-media-sync-performance.js
```

This will test the optimizations and provide performance metrics.

### Step 3: Monitor Performance

The enhanced sync service now includes comprehensive performance monitoring:

```javascript
// Get performance report
const report = syncService.getPerformanceReport();

// Log performance metrics
syncService.logPerformanceMetrics();
```

## Configuration Options

### Batch Sizing Configuration

```javascript
const config = {
  media: {
    batchSize: 2000,           // API batch size (optimized)
    propertyBatchSize: 500,    // Property batch size (increased)
    dbBatchSize: 100,          // Database batch size (maintained)
    throttleDelay: 750         // Throttling delay
  }
};
```

### Parallel Processing Configuration

```javascript
const CONCURRENT_BATCHES = 3; // Process up to 3 property batches in parallel
```
